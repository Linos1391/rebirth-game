## Introduction:

I made this game initially for my school project. And I think everyone should try it! I will still keep updating.

There are total 5 endings (2 are hidden).

<br>

## Requirements:
- Be a window user.
- Terminal size minimum is 80x24.
- Have fun.

<br>

## Controlling:

Use arrow keys to choose options. Then press `Enter` to confirm.
- `Up` & `Down` to move up and down
- `Left` & `Right` to to show and unshow child options.
**Notice:** If you cannot choose, that means it is not suppose to be chosen. Try `Right` or select another one.

In combat, choose either `Fight` or `Defend` or `Move` (escaping).
- `Fight`: If you choose the right style, you can one hit for enemy.
- `Defend`: There are two options `Block` and `Dodge`. `Block` has 50% success. `Dodge` has 75% success, but when failed, has 10% lose 2hp.
